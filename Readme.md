# Implementation of Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks using Pytorch

## Style Transfer with Deep Neural Networks


This notebook *recreates* a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch.

In this paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers. In the image below, the convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack. Conv1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv5_4.

### Separating Style and Content

Style transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, _target_ image which should contain our desired content and style components:

An example is shown below, where the content image is of a cat, and the style image is of [Hokusai's Great Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa). The generated target image still contains the cat but is stylized with the waves, blue and beige colors, and block print textures of the style image!

In this notebook, we'll use a pre-trained **VGG19 Net** to extract content or style features from a passed in image.
